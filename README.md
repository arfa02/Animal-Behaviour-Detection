# 🐾 Animal Behavior Detection using YOLOv8 and Stanford Dogs Dataset

This project focuses on detecting and classifying animal behavior — specifically dog behaviors — using **YOLOv8** object detection models trained on the **Stanford Dogs Dataset**. The goal is to develop a computer vision pipeline that can identify dogs and analyze their behavior in images or video streams.

##  Project Overview

**Model**: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
**Dataset**: [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/)
**Goal**: Detect dogs in images/videos and classify their behavior (e.g., sitting, standing, running, playing).
**Frameworks**: PyTorch, Ultralytics YOLOv8, OpenCV

##  Dataset: Stanford Dogs

The [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/) contains over 20,000 images of 120 breeds of dogs from ImageNet. For this project, we enhanced this dataset by labeling different **dog behaviors** manually or through augmentation tools.

> Note: The original dataset does not include behavior annotations — these were added in preprocessing.
